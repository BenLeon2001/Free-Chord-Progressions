All chords here are ROYALTY FREE for you and no license required! If you enjoy my chord progressions, I can create a chord progression based on scale and genre you specifically want on Patreon, with samplers there too 

I will still continue to add free chord progressions here reguarly! Thanks for viewing and have fun!

If you enjoy these progressions, please star this repo if you wish! It'll help a lot! :)

I can customze several midi files all at once to your liking (including melodies) as a member

edit: I understand it's easier to have them as seperate files over zip. Having thousands of inidivudal files makes it difficult, but i'll try and see how to make it easier for everyone!
