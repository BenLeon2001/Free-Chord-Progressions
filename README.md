All chords here are ROYALTY FREE for you and no license required! If you enjoy my chord progressions, I can create a chord progression based on scale and genre you specifically want on Patreon, with samplers there too 

I have a Discord Bot which is perfect for educational use as well as personal use for producers! If you're an educational place, feel free to send me a DM benleon415@gmail.com Here is a video of it: https://www.patreon.com/posts/welcome-to-eng-137248566

I will still continue to add free chord progressions here reguarly! Thanks for viewing and have fun!

edit: I understand it's easier to have them as seperate files over zip. Having thousands of inidivudal files makes it difficult, but i'll try and see how to make it easier for everyone!
